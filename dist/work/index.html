				<h1>The Medal of Honor</h1>
				<p>The Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation (CMOHF) Honors America’s greatest heroes. They strive to Promote American values and the qualities of courage, sacrifice, commitment, integrity, citizenship and patriotism through increased awareness, education and outreach. In 2016 they reached out to Sagepath to completely revamp their digital presence. At Sagepath, I was named the lead Front-end Developer for this project.</p>
				<div class="showMore">
					<h4>project overview</h3>
						<p>Over a period of several months, we build a completely new website for CMOHF. The new platform was built with a sitecore back-end to enable the client to quickly and easily update their content. Our team took an Agile aproach to the development process with daily scrums and bi-weekly sprints.</p>

						<h4>Personal Growth</h3>
							<p>Having great respect for the Congressional Medal of Honor, and a strong personal regard to their core values, I felt a tremendous responsibily while working on this project to get everything just right. In the end, that dedication translated to a cleaner final product, something I could be proud of. That experience fundamentally changed the way I look at projects, and made me a better developer because of it. I now strive to give that same level of excelence to every project I touch.</p>

							<p>This was also the first project I had the opportunity to work in a true agile envirenment. Learning from mistakes in a previous sprint, understanding the project's 'burn rate', and just having that high level of communication was a great asset.</p>

							<p>Being built into a CMS, each component needed to be reusable. Building semantic HTML that could be placed anywhere, in any size container, was a challenge. I had never built components for a true 'do as you like' CMS. Working closely with my backend resource and learning from prior mistakes, I now have a strong foundation for component based HTML & CSS.</p>
